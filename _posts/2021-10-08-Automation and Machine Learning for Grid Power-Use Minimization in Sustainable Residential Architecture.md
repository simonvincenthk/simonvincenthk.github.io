## Introduction

This is a (purely) theoretical efficacy study about achieving greater energy savings in sustainable residential architecture by applying automation and machine learning in a unique way.

Today…

Consider a passive solar home. A homesteader designed it with an 80 by 7 foot south-facing wall of windows to allow solar radiation to pass into the home. Desirable amounts of heating and cooling are achieved by manually opening and closing blinds and windows. The process is repetitive and labor-intensive, which makes it an excellent candidate for automation. 

Deciding when to, and how much to, open the blinds and windows is not trivial. A great deal of experience, or knowledge about thermal behaviour is needed to make the right decision. This decision making process would be addressed well using one of two of today’s common engineering methods—(1) machine learning, or (2) a traditional analytical heat-transfer model.

Achieving higher efficiencies in homes that are already designed to save energy may be possible or even generally applicable. It is the objective of this study to form a conclusion about whether this can be accomplished using an automation and machine learning approach.

In this article,
- a theoretical thermal FEA model is created to simulate sustainable residential architecture,
- a control system is devised as a substitute for real-world automation of blinds, and windows, and 
- a machine learning algorithm is built and implemented to make experience-based control decisions about how to achieve the user's setpoint while mitigating grid power use.

Lastly, several data points are studied analytically, and results are compared to vailate the success of the machine learning algorithm.
