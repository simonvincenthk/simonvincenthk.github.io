# Appendix B: Machine Learning with PyTourch and fastai
An appendix to *Automation and Machine Learning for Grid-Power Use Minimization in Sustainable Residential Architecture*

This appendix is a collection of notes, mostly from Howard and Guggerâ€™s book and teachings [^howardandgugger-20], aimed at giving the layperson context about and an understanding of the machine learning used in this study. It is broken up into two primary subsections: (B.1) a theoretical introduction and discussion about machine learning, and (B.2) a deeper explanation of the methods used in this study.
